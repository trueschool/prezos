# Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and Accessible HTML5 eLearning



---



Many theories of learning are rooted in psychology. 

UDL is an approach to design and technology that seeks to make learning accessible to learners of all levels of ability.

## UDL calls us to give learners...

- **Multiple means of representation** to give learners various ways of acquiring information and knowledge,
- **Multiple means of expression** to provide learners alternatives for demonstrating what they know, and
- **Multiple means of engagement** to tap into learners' interests, challenge them appropriately, and motivate them to learn

## An idea's journey from author to learner



When developing content, we are taking ideas from the mind of the subject matter expert and finding the best way to get it into the mind of the learner.

## Containers within Containers



Everybody who handles that information makes decisions (conscious and not) about how to contain the information, and we end up putting information into a series of nested containers, each that can potentially constrain our options later in the process.

Quite often in eLearning, the journey looks something like this: 

- SME contains their ideas in a PowerPoint slide deck or Word doc
- Instructional Designer imports PowerPoint into Captivate where they add interactivity, assessments, and visual interest
- Instructional Designer exports Captivate experience as SCORM package and uploads it into the LMS
- Learner accesses the lesson in a browser from their computer or mobile device



Sometimes, the learner also needs to use assistive devices like screen readers to get the content into their head if they do not have full use of all senses

## Don't Get "Got"

Often, someone along the journey makes a decision about how to contain their ideas that makes it harder to get their ideas to the finish line. 

Some common examples: 

- Writing your speaker notest directly into PowerPoint, just to find that there's no way to export them (at least on Mac)
- Writing text into an image file because it looks better, just to find that the content becomes invisible to blind users, search engines, and screen readers

## Respecting the Open Web

In online education, that journey must pass through the Web and the browser, so we need to take care to create learning experiences that will work when delivered over the Internet, following the rules of the Internet.
